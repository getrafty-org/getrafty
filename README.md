## About

If you've ever caught yourself wondering how things like distributed file systems work or what kind of magic keeps your favorite RPC library talking across the network — you're in the right place.

[Getrafty](https://getrafty.org/) is an attempt to make those big, intimidating systems feel small and approachable again. I'm occasionally putting together a series of tiny, minimalistic tasks that walk a reader through basic concepts while building our own toy version from scratch — step by step, no black boxes, no hand-waving.

Think of it as a guided tour through the internals of distributed systems — with code you can actually run and break.

## Contributing and Developing

So far, it's just been me hacking at this in my spare time, and it's open to anyone to contribute.

If you've found a bug, please create an issue (or better, a pull request) in the repository.
