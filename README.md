## About

Getrafty is an open, exploratory space for engineers who want to understand how distributed systems 
work by giving them a playground to build, test and break compact versions of them.

This is not a course. It's a collection of experiments and a playground.

## Contributing

The project is early and experimental. If you like exploring internals and learning in public, you’re welcome to join.

Ways to contribute:

- propose experiments or tasks,  
- add or improve code/tests,  
- write small explanations or diagrams,  
- open issues to discuss ideas,
- corrections.

Every contribution counts ❤️.
