# What
If you've ever caught yourself wondering how distributed file systems really work or what kind of magic keeps your favorite RPC framework talking across the network - you're in the right place.

This project is my attempt to make those big, intimidating systems feel small and approachable again. I'm occasionally putting together a series of tiny, minimalistic tasks that walk a reader through basic concepts while building our own toy version from scratch - step by step, no black boxes, no hand-waving.

Think of it as a guided tour through the internals of distributed systems - with code you can actually run and break.
