This project is an open series of write-ups and exercises on distributed systems inspired by MIT’s 6.824.

The main motivation behind this project is simply the joy of building things. That said, I believe it will also be useful for anyone interested in learning more about distributed systems. What you create here is entirely yours — every line of code belongs to you.

Please make sure to keep your repository private when forking. Avoid sharing solutions publicly. Thanks!
