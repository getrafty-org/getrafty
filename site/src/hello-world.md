## Tutorial

Your goal is to complete the method `computeTimeTravelSpeed` in class `back_to_the_future::Delorean` in the file `time_machine.h`. 

The method should return the speed measured in mph of a DeLorean time machine [to be able to travel in time](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DeLorean_time_machine#Operation).

##  Checking solution

Ensure your code pass clang-tidy lints.

Run `clippy test` inside `~/workspace/tasks/hello-world/`

```shell
$ cd ~/workspace/tasks/hello-world & clippy test
```

Iterate on the change until tests are passed.
