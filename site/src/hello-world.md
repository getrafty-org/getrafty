## Tutorial

### Goal

Your goal is to complete the method `computeTimeTravelSpeed` in class `DeLoreanTimeMachine` in the file `time_machine.h`. 

The method should return the speed measured in mph (miles per hour) of a delorean time machine [to be able to travel in time](https://www.reddit.com/r/forza/comments/bfcmoh/if_my_calculations_are_correct_when_this_baby/).

###  How to check solution

@TODO: Lints and formats.

Run `clippy test` inside `~/workspace/tasks/hello-world/` 

```bash
clippy test
```
