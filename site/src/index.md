# Let's Get Rafty

This project is an open series of write-ups and exercises on distributed systems inspired by [MIT’s 6.824](https://pdos.csail.mit.edu/archive/6.824-2012/).

The main motivation behind this project is simply the joy of building things. That said, I believe it will also be useful for anyone interested in learning more about distributed systems. What you create here is entirely yours — every line of code belongs to you.

Please make sure to keep your repository private when forking. Avoid sharing solutions publicly. Thanks!



## Goal

In this class we will design a toy distributed file system from the very scratch, step by step. Start with implementation of concurrency primitives and making they form bigger abstractions such as communication protocols and consensus algorithms.

## Contributing

I've started to write things here very recently, so the contents are very immature and incomplete. I am open to any suggestions and contributions.
If you have found a bug, please create an issue (or pull request) [in the repository](https://github.com/sidosera/getrafty).
If you have an idea of a new lab or task, great! Please create an issue with the idea, and we will discuss it.

*Why the name "Getrafty"? That appeared to me as a funny game of words, one of the fundamental concept introduced in this class is the [Raft Consensus Algorithm](https://raft.github.io/)*.
