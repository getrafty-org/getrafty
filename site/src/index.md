## What

This project features a range of exercises on distributed systems offering a grasp overview of the space. If you've ever been curious about how [distributed file systems](https://static.googleusercontent.com/media/research.google.com/en//archive/gfs-sosp2003.pdf) function or wanted to explore the inner workings of [your favorite RPC framework](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apache_Thrift). Then, it's the right place here because you will build a fully functioning toy version of that yourself

Get ready, it will be fun ;)

*Why the name "Getrafty"? That appeared to me as a funny game of words, one of the fundamental concept introduced in this class is the [Raft Consensus Algorithm](https://raft.github.io/)*.
