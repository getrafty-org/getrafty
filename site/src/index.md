# Let's Get Rafty

This project is an effort to create an open series of write-ups and exercises on distributed systems. The project is inspired by the [MIT 6.824](https://pdos.csail.mit.edu/archive/6.824-2012/) 2010s class on distributed systems with a good chunk of exercises in this reflecting the contents of the original class. Although, this project exerices differ in many ways to reflect the changes in the industry over the last decade.

The ultimate motivation for this project is to just craft things becasue itâ€™s fun. Although, I expect it to be useful for anyone who is interested in the field. Everything you craft belongs to you, you have every single line of it.


Please, when forking a repository, make it private. Do not publish solutions to problems in the public. Thnks!

## What do we do

In this class we will design a toy distributed file system from the very scratch, step by step. Start with implementation of concurrency primitives and making they form a bigger abstractions such as communication protocols and consensus algorithms.

Why the name "Getrafty"? That appeared to me as a funny game of words, one of the fundamental concept introduced in this class is the [Raft Consensus Algorithm](https://raft.github.io/).
