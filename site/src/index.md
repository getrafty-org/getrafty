# Let's Get Rafty

This project is an open series of write-ups and exercises on distributed systems inspired by [MITâ€™s 6.824](https://pdos.csail.mit.edu/archive/6.824-2012/).

The main motivation behind this project is simply the joy of building things. That said, I believe it will also be useful for anyone interested in learning more about distributed systems. What you create here is entirely yours â€” every line of code belongs to you.

Please make sure to keep your repository private when forking. Avoid sharing solutions publicly. Thanks!



## What do we do

In this class we will design a toy distributed file system from the very scratch, step by step. Start with implementation of concurrency primitives and making they form a bigger abstractions such as communication protocols and consensus algorithms.

Why the name "Getrafty"? That appeared to me as a funny game of words, one of the fundamental concept introduced in this class is the [Raft Consensus Algorithm](https://raft.github.io/).
